      <p>Firstly thank you for coming to my ted talk.</p>
      <p>
        This website and the infra behind it is way over engineered, but thats
        just so I can show you what I can do! I have built this site with Next
        JS, impolemented a build process, testing and automatic deployment on
        success - Oh and also a version bump/tagging stage. All/most of that
        unnessesary for a vanity website, but as I said I want to showcase my
        ability ðŸ˜Š
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a software engineer with a passion for building scalable and
        efficient applications. I have experience in various programming
        languages and frameworks, and I love to learn new technologies.
      </p>
